## 💻 Oi, I'm Leticia Azevedo 🌺

I’m a smart contract developer in the making, actively building on the EVM with Solidity and Foundry. I believe the next wave of blockchain innovation depends on smart, secure, and gas-efficient contracts, and I'm here to help build it!

🌍 From Brazil, building globally.

**Current stack & tools:**
- Solidity, Foundry (unit testing, scripting, mocking, fuzzing)
- Chainlink Price Feeds, VRF & Automation
- JavaScript & React (for frontend integration)
- Git & GitHub (version control & open-source collaboration)

**Ongoing projects:**
- 💸 DeFi Stablecoin Protocol (exogenous, overcollateralized)
- 🔒 Smart Contract Security course (Cyfrin)
