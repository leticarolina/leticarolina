## 💻 Oi, I'm Leticia Azevedo 🌸

I’m a smart contract developer in the making, actively building on the EVM with Solidity and Foundry. Passionate about the potential of blockchain, I’m currently focused on mastering smart contract development and security.

🌍 From Brazil, building globally.

**Current stack & tools:**
- Solidity, Foundry (unit testing, scripting, mocking, fuzzing)
- Chainlink VRF & Automation
- JavaScript & React (for frontend integration)
- Git & GitHub (version control & open-source collaboration)

**Ongoing projects:**
- 🎟️ Raffle contract using Chainlink VRF (Foundry + VRF v2.5)
- 🔒 Smart Contract Security course (Cyfrin)
